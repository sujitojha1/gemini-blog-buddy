- Implement a FastAPI backend that powers retrieval, orchestration, and response generation.

## High-Level Plan
- [x] Practice RAG basics in the practice folder and learn UV, install ollama, FAISS, and embeddings
- [x] Create a chrome extension in new folder and basic extension with button index the document and find the document with search text
- [x] Set up a FastAPI backend scaffold (server folder) that returns placeholder responses for extension actions
- [ ] Define data contracts and interaction flows for the MCP components.
- [ ] Build the FastAPI backend, including retrieval pipelines and orchestration logic.
- [ ] Implement the Chrome extension UI and background services.
- [ ] Integrate the extension with the backend and validate end-to-end behaviors.
- [ ] Add automated tests, deployment scripts, and user-facing documentation.
