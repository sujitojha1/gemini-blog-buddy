# RAG Application – Chrome Extension

## Objective
Deliver Gemini Blog Buddy: a retrieval-augmented Chrome extension that curates standout content on AI, LLMs, and agentic systems from read blog posts, captures what you read, and resurfaces it on demand for learning, research, or project inspiration.

## Requirements
- Incorporate an MCP-based orchestration layer featuring the Agent, Perception, Memory, Action, and Decision components.
- Provide a JavaScript-based Chrome extension as the front-end experience.
- Implement a FastAPI backend that powers retrieval, orchestration, and response generation.

## High-Level Plan
- [ ] Practice RAG basics in the practice folder and learn UV, install ollama, FAISS, and embeddings
- [ ] Capture the primary user journeys and Chrome extension UX requirements.
- [ ] Define data contracts and interaction flows for the MCP components.
- [ ] Build the FastAPI backend, including retrieval pipelines and orchestration logic.
- [ ] Implement the Chrome extension UI and background services.
- [ ] Integrate the extension with the backend and validate end-to-end behaviors.
- [ ] Add automated tests, deployment scripts, and user-facing documentation.
